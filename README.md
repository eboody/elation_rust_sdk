# [[ðŸ“Œ Project Todos]]:

- [ ] Implemented the Client Module (libs/client/):

Created the Client struct to handle HTTP requests and authentication.
Implemented HTTP methods (get, post, put, delete) with proper error handling.
Added support for query parameters by introducing the Params trait.
Defined custom error handling in client::error.rs with an Error enum covering various HTTP and parsing errors.
Developed Data Models (libs/models/):

- [ ] Created data models for patients in patient_profile.rs.
Defined structs like Patient, PatientForCreate, PatientQueryParams, etc.
Implemented enums for categorical data (e.g., Sex, GenderIdentity, Race, Ethnicity).
Used serde for serialization and deserialization, with custom date formats using the time crate.
Ensured all models implement necessary traits like Serialize, Deserialize, and Default.
Built the Services Module (libs/services/):

- [ ] Implemented PatientService with methods to interact with the patient API endpoints:
get_patient
create_patient
update_patient
delete_patient
find_patients
Handled errors appropriately by wrapping client::Error in services::Error and adding service-specific error variants.
Used the Params trait to handle query parameters in service methods.
Wrote Unit Tests for PatientService:

- [ ] Used httpmock to mock HTTP responses and simulate API interactions in tests.
Covered success scenarios for all service methods.
Tested error handling by simulating API errors like 404 Not Found.
Ensured all tests pass successfully, verifying the correctness of service methods.
Managed Error Handling Across Modules:

- [ ] Avoided duplication of error definitions by reusing client::Error in the services crate.
Wrapped client::Error in services::Error to propagate client errors while allowing for service-specific errors.
Implemented error conversion and display logic to provide meaningful error messages.
Enhanced the Client for Query Parameters:

- [ ] Modified the Client struct to handle query parameters effectively.
Added a generic get method that accepts parameters implementing the Params trait.
Defined the Params trait requiring Serialize and Default implementations.
Applied the Params trait to parameter structs like PatientQueryParams.
Documented Code and Modules:

- [ ] Added documentation comments (///) to all public structs, enums, methods, and functions.
Provided examples where helpful to illustrate usage.
Ensured code is well-documented for better maintainability and user understanding.
Outlined the Project Structure:

- [ ] Created a detailed markdown outline of the entire project.
Included descriptions of each module and their key components.
Provided a file and module hierarchy for visualization.
Prepared the outline for use in note-taking apps like Obsidian.

## Additional Notes

- **Error Handling**:
  - The SDK uses custom `Error` enums in both the `client` and `services` crates.
  - Errors are designed to be informative and to encapsulate underlying causes.

- **Logging**:
  - (Planned) Incorporation of logging for debugging and monitoring.

- **Documentation**:
  - All public structs, enums, and methods are documented using `///` comments.
  - Examples are provided where helpful.

- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Implementation of additional services (`ProblemService`, `AllergyService`, etc.).
  - Integration of continuous integration (CI) workflows.
  - Expansion of test coverage and addition of integration tests.
  - Preparation for publishing the SDK, including updating metadata and adding a README.

use services::PatientService;
use models::patient_profile::{PatientForCreate, Sex};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Initialize the client
    let client = Client::new().await?;

    // Create a patient service instance
    let patient_service = PatientService::new(&client);

    // Create a new patient
    let new_patient = PatientForCreate {
        first_name: "Jane".to_string(),
        last_name: "Doe".to_string(),
        dob: time::Date::from_calendar_date(1990, time::Month::January, 1)?,

        emails: None,
        insurances: vec![],
    };

    let patient = patient_service.create_patient(&new_patient).await?;

    println!("Created patient with ID: {}", patient.id);

    Ok(())
