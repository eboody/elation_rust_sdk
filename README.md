# Outline
## Overview

This project is a Rust SDK for interacting with the Elation EMR API. It includes modules for handling clients, services, models, errors, and tests. The SDK is designed to be robust, type-safe, and easy to use.

---

## Example Usage

```rust
use client::Client;
use services::PatientService;
use models::patient_profile::{PatientForCreate, Sex};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Initialize the client
    let client = Client::new().await?;

    // Create a patient service instance
    let patient_service = PatientService::new(&client);

    // Create a new patient
    let new_patient = PatientForCreate {
        first_name: "Jane".to_string(),
        last_name: "Doe".to_string(),
        dob: time::Date::from_calendar_date(1990, time::Month::January, 1)?,
        sex: Sex::Female,
        primary_physician: 123,
        caregiver_practice: 456,
        address: None,
        emails: None,
        insurances: vec![],
    };

    let patient = patient_service.create_patient(&new_patient).await?;

    println!("Created patient with ID: {}", patient.id);

    Ok(())
}
```
